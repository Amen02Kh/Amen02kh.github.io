<h1>Introduction</h1>

The **Practical Junior Penetration Tester (PJPT)** by **TCM Security** is an
<span class="text-highlight">entry-level, fully hands-on</span> certification designed to validate foundational penetration testing skills in a realistic environment.

The certification costs **$249**, and students can request a **20% discount voucher**.

This article is based entirely on my personal experience and strictly respects the certification’s integrity.

<h1>Before Attempting PJPT</h1>

PJPT was my <span class="text-highlight">first professional cybersecurity certification</span>.

Before attempting it, my experience mainly came from:
- TryHackMe learning paths
- Hack The Box modules and a few archived machines

However, I had **little to no prior experience with Active Directory**, apart from the *Introduction to Active Directory* module on Hack The Box.

To be honest, Active Directory felt **intimidating**. The sheer amount of available learning material made it overwhelming, to the point where I actively avoided AD-focused labs.

<h1>Why PJPT</h1>

Although there are other certifications available in a similar price range, I chose PJPT for three main reasons:

- **A free second exam attempt**, which was extremely reassuring for my first hands-on certification
- **A fully practical exam**, with no artificial flags, focused on realistic Active Directory scenarios
- **Course material that fully prepares you**, even with no prior AD experience, which was a huge confidence boost for me

<h1>The Course: Practical Ethical Hacking</h1>

The course is primarily created by **Heath Adams**, with a dedicated **web exploitation** section developed by **Alex Olsen**.

It covers a wide range of topics, including:
- Networking fundamentals
- Linux and enumeration
- Web exploitation basics
- Active Directory attacks and methodology

Throughout the course, Heath Adams places strong emphasis on
<span class="text-highlight">note-taking and methodology</span>.

Below is an example of how I personally organized my notes:

Each topic is first explained conceptually before moving to execution, which helps you understand **why** an attack works rather than just **how** to run a tool.

<strong>Key takeaway:</strong> The course prioritizes methodology and enumeration over tool memorization.

<h1>The Exam</h1>

At the start of the exam, you receive:
- The **Rules of Engagement**
- An **OpenVPN configuration file**

You are given:
- **48 hours** to complete the exam
- **48 additional hours** to submit a professional penetration testing report

To succeed, applying the correct methodology is critical. Treating the exam like a CTF can easily lead to failure.

In my case, I completed the technical part in **6–7 hours**, despite some VM-related issues. However, I **failed my first attempt** due to insufficient reporting.

I did not capture enough screenshots and only documented the main compromise path. TCM Security’s feedback confirmed that the technical compromise was valid, but the report lacked depth.

I corrected this during my second attempt.

<div class="callout callout-warning">
<strong>Lesson learned:</strong> A good penetration tester is not defined only by technical skills, but also by clear communication and professional reporting.

<h1>My Feedback</h1>

I genuinely enjoyed both the course and the exam — the experience felt **realistic and practical**.

PJPT is an excellent <span class="text-highlight">introduction to Active Directory</span> and provides a solid foundation to build upon. While many advanced AD topics are not covered, this is expected for an entry-level certification.

<div class="callout callout-success">
<strong>Recommendation:</strong> I highly recommend PJPT to anyone with little or no prior Active Directory experience who wants a serious hands-on introduction to penetration testing.
